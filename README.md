The ReConf JVM Project is an ecosystem that provides an easy way to utilize smart configurations in a Java application.

No more String parsing
======================

A smart configuration is comprised of several items, where each item is basically a key-value pair written in a special - yet simple - syntax, which allows the library to automatically build the correct Java type. It doesn't matter whether it's a String, a boolean, a Map, a List or any other complex type.

Just enough XML
===============
ReConf Client relies on a simple and straightforward XML configuration file. Just enough to know a little bit about your environment. The rest of the framework integrates seamlessly through annotations.

No more boilerplate code
=========================

Enough with frameworks that are too complex to use. Just create a plain old Java interface, decorate it with a few custom annotations, call a factory method and that's it! Your application is good to go.
